## launchpad1

### Assignment Description

This was a simple assignment that had us have a code output a countdown from 10 to 0 and say lift off at the end.
### Evidence

### Code
[code](raspberry-pi/countdown.py).

### Reflection

This was an pretty easy assignment despite my lack of coding ability, the hard part was making sure that i could document it in the right place. 



## launchpad2

### Assignment Description

this was the second in a siries of assignments about coding an countdown to launch for a pico board. This one added on the requierment to have a LED flash during the countdown and a different LED stay on after the countdown reached zero. 

### Evidence

### Code
[code](raspberry-pi/launpad2.py).

### Reflection

this assignment made us have a light blink during the countdown, it was relatively easy as i only needed to modify the code before and add some LED code to make this work. As I was behind in work due to sickness it was nice that mason divers could help out with the LED setup code. 

## launchpad3

### Assignment Description

This was a assignment that had us have a code output a countdown from 10 to 0 after a button was pressed. 
### Evidence

### Code
[code](raspberry-pi/launchpad3.py).

### Reflection

This was an pretty easy assignment despite my lack of coding ability, the hard part was making sure that i could document it in the right place. 































## Raspberry_Pi_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Evidence 

Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here. You need to communicate what your thing does. 

### Wiring

This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here. The diagram should be clear enough that I can recreate the wiring from scratch. 

### Code
Give me a link to your code. [Something like this](https://github.com/millerm22/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Raspberry_Pi/hello_world.py). Don't make me hunt through your folders, give me a nice link to click to take me there! Remember to **COMMENT YOUR CODE** if you want full credit. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
